# LoRaWAN

All LoRaWan code are based on Arduino-LMIC library ("MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC Library") : https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lorawan

The Library has been configured for UCA21 board.

# LoRaWAN timing issue

In \libraries\arduino-lmic\project_config\lmic_project_config.h

Add  `#define LMIC_ENABLE_arbitrary_clock_error 1`

In your loraWan code, add after LMIC_reset in setup() :
` LMIC_setClockError(MAX_CLOCK_ERROR * 2 / 100);`
    
    
Make LMIC start its RX windows a bit earlier, to compensate for an inaccurate clock.
Beware that a specific value may work for a slow data rate, but not for faster ones, and remember that RX1 may use different data rates than RX2. Like for some tests, RX2 in EU868 (using SF9) worked with the standard settings, but RX1 for SF8 needed 2%, while RX1 for SF7 even needed 5% of the maximum error. For corrections exceeding 0.4% (0.4 / 100) this also needs LMIC_ENABLE_arbitrary_clock_error; see
